# OOPsShowcase

A collection of Java projects demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts such as:

- Classes & Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Encapsulation  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  

This repository is designed to showcase practical implementations of OOPs concepts in Java.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects

### 1. ComplexNumbers
Implementation of a `Complex` class to perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.

**Concepts used:** Classes, Objects, Static Methods, Encapsulation  

**Features:**  
- Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of complex numbers  
- Printing complex numbers in readable format  

---

### 2. ShapeHierarchy
Demonstrates **Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism** using a shape hierarchy.

**Concepts used:** Abstract Classes, Method Overriding, Polymorphism  

**Features:**  
- Abstract class `Shape` with abstract methods `area()` and `perimeter()`  
- Subclasses:
  - `Circle` (field: radius)  
  - `Rectangle` (fields: length, width)  
- Polymorphic references to store different shapes
