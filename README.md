# OOPsShowcase

A collection of Java projects demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts such as:

- Classes & Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Encapsulation  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  

This repository showcases practical implementations of OOPs concepts in Java.

## üìÇ Project Categories

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Projects
Simple foundational OOPs projects demonstrating classes, objects, and encapsulation.

#### **ComplexNumbers**
- **Concepts used**: Classes, Objects, Static Methods, Encapsulation  
- **Features**:  
  - Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of complex numbers  
  - Printing complex numbers in readable format  
- **Description**:  
  Implementation of a `Complex` class to perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.

#### **BankAccount**
- **Concepts used**: Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Methods, Input Validation  
- **Features**:  
  - Deposit and withdraw money with balance check  
  - Secure PIN authentication for transactions (simulating UPI/ATM flow)  
  - Validation for insufficient balance and invalid amounts  
  - Menu-driven program with exit option (`E` to exit)  
- **Description**:  
  A simple banking simulation project demonstrating encapsulation and user validation in OOP. Users can deposit, withdraw, and check their balance by entering a PIN.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Minor Projects
Projects demonstrating inheritance, abstraction, and method overriding.

#### **ShapeHierarchy**
- **Concepts used**: Abstract Classes, Method Overriding, Polymorphism  
- **Features**:  
  - Abstract class `Shape` with abstract methods `area()` and `perimeter()`  
  - Subclasses:  
    - `Circle` (field: radius)  
    - `Rectangle` (fields: length, width)  
  - Polymorphic references to store different shapes  
- **Description**:  
  Demonstrates Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism using a shape hierarchy.

## üöÄ Roadmap
- Add more projects to demonstrate **Interfaces**, **Abstract Classes**, and **Advanced OOPs concepts**.  
- Introduce **File Handling**, **Exception Handling**, and **Collections** in OOPs projects.  
- Develop **mini real-world projects** like Library Management System, Student Management System, and E-Commerce Simulation.

---
- More projects will be added to demonstrate **interfaces, abstract classes, and advanced OOPs concepts**.
